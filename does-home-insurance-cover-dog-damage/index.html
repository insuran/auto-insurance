Do German Shepherds Increase Homeowners Insurance? The German Shepherder From thegermanshepherder.com
A homeowner’s policy will exclude coverage for damage caused by your pet (dog, cat, rodent, etc.) both inside the house and outside. As your basic homeowners policy does, your comprehensive auto insurance provides coverage for a vehicle against the sort of perils that. If you come home to find the family pooch chewing through the leg of your prized antique chair, it’s highly unlikely you’re going to be able to claim for pet damage if you only have. Homeowners insurance generally won’t cover property damage caused by animals, including birds, insects, rodents, or vermin.
