<p>Why do pilots say super? The controllers will tell the aircraft to move onto the runway and. For that reason, air traffic controllers say the word “super” or “heavy” when identifying nearby aircraft that fall under those categories, so pilots of other planes will know to stay clear. All of the above are true but that�s not why aircraft are called heavy.</p>

<p>When aircraft reach an altitude above 18,000 feet, the route center controller takes over, using radar to guide aircraft at cruising altitudes until the plane begins its descent. In the united states, aircraft capable of a maximum takeoff weight of 300,000 pounds or more are classified as heavy, even if the aircraft happens to be. The term heavy is used during radio transmissions between air traffic control and any aircraft which has been assigned a maximum takeoff weight (mtow) rating of 136 tonnes (300,000 lb). 635576153478323625APNewAirportSaltLakeCity.jpg?width=2998&amp;height.</p>
